Jesse Levisohn

I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Politics. I took this class 
because I am interested in doing data analysis for public policy research. 
Although I am not sure what I want to do after college, this summer I am 
applying to a few jobs where I would be a software or data intern at a 
climate technology company. Outside of class, I play on the ultimate frisbee team.
